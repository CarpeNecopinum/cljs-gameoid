# CLJS-Gameoid

Playground to try out some game-like things in ClojureScript.
No central vision, just screwing around, maybe getting something cool out of it, but at least learning something.

## Running

For now, this has to be run interactively in a REPL. I'm using VSCode with Calva and use the Jack-in command with "deps.edn + ClosureScript built-in for browser" mode.
